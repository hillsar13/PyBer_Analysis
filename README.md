# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the client, Pyber, with a data summary and visualization reflecting ride sharing data by city type. We will review the findings and make appropriate recommendations according to our results for future consideration by the company. 

## Results

- Urban data reported the highest total rides, drivers, & fares, while Rural data reflects the highest average fare per rider & fare per driver.

- When looking at average weekly fare per city type, Urban data reports the highest consistent weekly fare over a 4 month period, followed by Suburban fare, and Rural fare.

## Summary
There are numerous takeaways to the results of our analysis. Perhaps as expected, a higher density population area (Urban) may be explain the higher rates of total rides, drivers, and highest weekly average sum. If looking solely at profit, adding additional urban drivers to meet demand may continue to yield promising weekly results. An second take away from the graph in particular reflects a snapshot of the year in general (looking from January to April). Continued monitoring of this trend is necessary to see if there are any shifts or changes to the pattern of data (such as the perceived uptick in weekly average sum by Suburban data type nearing the end of April). A final takeaway to note from the summary dataframes reflects an inverse relationship between the city types. Such as, the Urban city type had higher total rides, drivers, & total fares, but had lower average fares per ride/driver. Whereas the Rural city type had lower total rides, drivers, & total fares, but had higher average fares per rider/driver. Perhaps this is explained by the distance
